# RELIP
This project was done in the scope of the BTS-Internet of Things in the Lycée des Arts et Métiers Luxembourg with the help of Bâtiment Public Luxembourg.
The Real Life Project's objective was to make a functioning device that decrypts the data from the luxembourgish smart electrical meter and sends it out via ModBus TCP and/or RTU.
